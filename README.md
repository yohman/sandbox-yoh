## Setting up your development environment

Launch terminal, and navigate to the folder where the clone for your forked repository resides. Enter the following command:

```
mkdocs serve
```

Open a browser and enter the provided local URL (such as http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

All front end edits should be made in the `docs` folder, which will automatically update the content. 

Once you are satisfied with your edits, build the site with the following command:

```
mkdocs build
```
This will update the content in the `site` folder, which is served to the public.
